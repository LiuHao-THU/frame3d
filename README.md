# Tensorflow-ResNet50
Trainable ResNet50 ResNet101 ResNet152 DenNet121 DenseNet161 using Python3.5 + Tensorflow

1. ResNet50 Class is defined in ResNet.py
2. Some useful functions are defined in utils.py
3. Use TrainResNet.py to train your own model
4. Use TestResNet.py to extract ResNet50 feature.
5. debug.py is used to debug (based on author's project), which may not be useful in your project.

TrainResNet.py and TestResNet.py are designed to fit author's project, you should make some modification before using it.
